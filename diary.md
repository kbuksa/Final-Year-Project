Saved simulator and files in the repository under 'program' package.

# Week 28/11/22 - 04/12/22

## 29/11

Researched how to use ROS in more detail. Created 2 simple programs for POC on ROS. 'Publisher.py' will 'publish' a random number in the ROS system at a constant rate. 'Subscriber.py' will read and display such information published from 'Publisher.py'
